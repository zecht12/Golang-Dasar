## Introduction to Go

Go (or Golang) is an open-source programming language designed for simplicity, reliability, and efficiency. It was created at Google and is known for its concurrency support and robust standard library.

## Variables and Data Types

Variables in Go are statically typed, meaning their type is determined at compile-time. Here are some basic types:

- **int**: Integer type
- **float64**: Floating point type
- **string**: Sequence of characters
- **bool**: Boolean type

Example:
```go
var age int = 30
var name string = "Alice"
var isStudent bool = true
